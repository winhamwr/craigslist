$700 / 1800ft2 - 3rd bedroom in baller downtown apt (downtown)
==============================================================

Up for rent is the 3rd bedroom in our 3 BR, 2 bath downtown apartment
with immediate availability
and up to a 12-month term.
We're on the 8th floor of The Block apartments,
located on Illinois and Market,
one block west of the circle in the heart of downtown.
You will probably love it.

We're two 27ish engineering-type nerdy dudes
and this will be our 3rd year in this place
(it's too awesome to leave).
We have a home theatre PC entertainment system
and a kegerator
(Founder's Centennial IPA currently on tap).
We found our last roommate via Craigslist
and it worked out awesome,
but he moved to Chicago for work.

Here is a google photo album
