# DELECTABLY DOWNTOWN APARTMENT AVAILABLE

If youâ€™re looking for a cozy, clean, affordable and mostly quiet place to call home base in the city for at least 6 months, living here would be a **capital** idea. All this apartment needs to feel complete is your fun-loving, adventurous self plus your bedroom furniture and preferably your own toothbrush. ;P

## THE NEST

This 3-bedroom, 2-bath space stretches over 1,600 square feet and flaunts 20-foot vaulted ceilings in the kitchen and living room where one wall is windowed, another projects our streamed movies and another displays our giant classroom roller map of the world.

## THE BACKYARD

Yes, I said "delectably downtown" because The Block apartments are so close to the circle, you can taste it. Nestled in the heart of downtown on the corner of Market and Illinois, you'll be able to enjoy walking or biking to all your favorite Indy spots.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

All this and more for less than $800/month! (Rent varies by room.)

We've been in this apartment for 5 years, so our grandfathered rent makes it possible to crush the typical downtown one-bedroom sticker price of ~$1300.

If you're interested in learning more, please use the Craigslist email contact and please include the phrase `"I <3 downtown"` somewhere in your message so that I can weed out bots and folks that don't read. I can't wait to meet you!

## FAQ

Q: What is the parking sitch?

A: For $135/month, you get a parking spot in the connected parking garage. Kiss winter windshield scraping goodbye.

Q: When is the lease period in question?

A: January 1 - June 30 with the option to renew after that. Even if I move in July, you'll have the option to pick up a new lease after that. It's a great way to avoid waiting lists and jump right into a downtown apartment.

Q: What about a short-term lease?

A: I'm open to the idea, but I'd really prefer something for the rest of our lease period. January 1 - June 30

Q: What extra costs should I expect?

A: In 2015, we averaged $57.66 per person per month between electric and broadband internet (no cable TV). The high was $67.16 in March and the low was $48.32 in May.
