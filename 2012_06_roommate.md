$750 / 1800ft2 - 3rd bedroom in baller downtown apt (downtown)
==============================================================

## Are you awesome?

* Do you want to continue to be awesome
  and to do so in a baller-tastic downtown Indianapolis apartment?
* Is a 45-second trip to the circle a thing that you value?
* Want to be capable of walking from your apartment
  to the mall without stepping outside?
* Does a 5-minute walk home from the downtown bars sound swell?

If you answered yes to all of these questions, then sweet.
Has anyone ever told you that you have excellent taste?

Also, you're pretty cool and I like your shoes.

Wanna hang out?

## Up for rent

Up for rent is the 3rd bedroom in our 3 BR,
2 bath downtown apartment
with **immediate availability**.
We're on the 8th floor of **The Block** apartments,
located on *Illinois and Market*,
one block west of the circle in the heart of downtown.

We love it.

We're two 27yo (that's internet speak for Years Old) dudes
and this will be our 3rd year in this place
(it's too awesome to leave).
Our previous roommate (hi Z) just moved back to Chicago,
so that means we get to meet you!
We've had really good luck with roommies on Craigslist
and we hope you will help us continue rolling 20's.

Things which we have that are awesome:

* A home theatre PC entertainment system
* A Kegbot\*-equipped kegerator
* A toy helicopter capable of traversing our 30-foot living room ceiling

Things we prefer in a roommate:

* Ability and preference for consumption of large quantities of meat.
  Specifically, bacon.
* An awesome sense of humor
  without being funnier than Wes,
  because he probably can't handle the competition.
* A lifestyle conducive to being awesome
  in both a professional and pre-professional context.

If living downtown is something you desire
and being awesome is something you do,
be awesome together, we should.

\* Our Kegbot uses a flowmeter,
an arduino
and RFID tags to keep stats on beer usage
and display them in a web interface.
Like I said, uber geeks.

Sometimes, cooking happens here. Primarily bacon:

Outside our apartment.
The Block was an old department store,
which increases the awesometude with a sweet atrium.

so they suck less than ours.

## FAQ

### Q: Is parking included in the $750?

**A:** The $750 includes a parking spot in the connected parking garage.
If you don't need a car,
or already have parking,
knock $125 off that.

### Q: What about a short-term lease?

**A:** We're open to the idea,
but we'd really prefer something for the rest of our lease period.

### Q: When is your lease up?

**A:** March 2013

### Q: What extra costs should I expect?

**A:** In 2011, we averaged $100.65 per person per month between
utilities,
water delivery,
broadband internet
and bi-weekly cleaning services
(for the bathrooms and common areas).
You should expect about the same.

### Q: $400 per month, final offer. But I'm really cool!

**A:** That's not even a question, Whitney.

### Q: Are you guys awesome?

**A:** Totally.
